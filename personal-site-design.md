What is you site's primary purpose?

The primary purpose of my site is to learn how to build a website by applying the design concepts we have covered.  I will also share my experience, learnings and other stuff about my EDA.  Essentially it will tell people about me and showcase the skills I have learned at Dev Academy.  



Who is your target audience?

Ultimately the website I create will be part of my portfolio for prospective employers.  In future it could be a reference for people thinking of enrolling at EDA.  



How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want my target audience to be able to interact with my site regardless of what device they are using.  I want it to be a user friendly experience for the end user.  My design process will begin with this in mind.  My motivation to join Dev academy was in part the frustration I have experienced as a consumer.  I like the Design and frameworks concepts covered in this sprint and will use the responsive design model and information covered in the Intellectual Architect resources to make visiting my site a positive experience.  I want them to be able to find the information they are looking for and be able to navigate my site with ease.  Not sure if my technical skills will allow that but Iâ€™ll try.



How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I now realise how important the design planning process is and will invest time in planning to ensure I can execute what I would like on my site. I guess with my limited experience I am going to try and keep things simple and do them well rather than trying to do some harder things and getting frustrated and lost.  I have a vision in my head but realise I may not be able to achieve that product in the required timeframe. I will focus on the process and not the end product (for now).  

I like the idea of using CSS/HTML frameworks as a template to work off. I will try use this in building my new site. I will invest time organising the information always having the end user needs in mind and not my own.  I will boxify my design and use wireframes as a visual representation of the elements of my site.  I think for now I'll go with the less is more approach and start small and try and do them well and understand what I'm doing before I try out some harder things.
